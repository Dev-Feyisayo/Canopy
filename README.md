## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to Canopy, your go-to solution for Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). This application lets you manage remote resources easily, regardless of how you choose to serialize data or the communication method you select. 

## 🔍 What is Canopy?
Canopy is designed to provide a simple yet powerful RPC solution. It supports various serialization formats like JSON and Protocol Buffers, and it works with different transport protocols including TCP and WebSockets. This means you have the flexibility to choose what fits your project best. 

With remote RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) object management, Canopy makes it easy to handle remote resources without complicated setups. Whether you are working on local projects or distributed systems, Canopy simplifies your workflow.

## 📋 Features
- **Flexible Serialization**: Choose between JSON, Protocol Buffers, and FlatBuffers.
- **Multiple Transports**: Communicate over TCP, REST, or WebSockets.
- **Coroutine Support**: Easily integrate with coroutine libraries for asynchronous programming.
- **Remote Resource Management**: Manage resources efficiently with remote RAII.
- **Support for Enclaves**: Enhance security using enclave-based computing.

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
